I don't really like the comments app included with Django.  This app provides an alternative to `django.contrib.comments`

This app is going to be *opinionated*.  That means there won't be mounds of customization & settings.  Instead, I'm doing things exactly how I want them.  If that suits you, great!  Otherwise feel free to fork this app and modify to your preference.

This will be an updated and revamped version of my previous [django-simple-comments](http://code.google.com/p/django-simple-comments/) app

## February 25, 2014

Updated core functionality to Django 1.6.

The app is known to run on Python 2.7.
